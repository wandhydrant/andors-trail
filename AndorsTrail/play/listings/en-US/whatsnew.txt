I put both (release notes + forum announcement) into this source, so it will be easier to maintain them parallel:

APK 62 (0.7.15)  //just fixes+translations

Release notes
=============
* Various small changes and bug fixes
* Translations actualized


Forum announcement  //2021-12-1x
==================
Hello fellow adventurers,

here is a new Andor's Trail! 8-)

There is no new content - and also no christmas edition  (awww)
We publish this release mainly to fix a nasty bug that could prevent you from getting entry to the Elm mine.

This is what we have done:
- Fix of missing scout and of a non disappearing Ortholion in certain conditions
- Venom dagger gets poisonous
- actual translations
- diverse fixes of little bugs and typos

And here is the link to the productive version: static/AndorsTrail_v0.7.15.apk



APK 61 (0.7.14)  //Omi2

Release notes
=============
Two new quests:
"Climbing up is forbidden"  south east of Prim
"You're the postman"  near home
24 new maps

Turkish translation available

Changed savegame location due to Google requirements
Not only for any PERMADEATH characters it would be a good idea to save before updating.


Forum announcement  //2021-11-08
==================
Hello fellow adventurers,

here is the new Andor's Trail release now! 8-)
Download it from our forum storage, or wait a few more days for Google play or FDroid.

:!: If you had tested a beta in the last weeks, you must deinstall it first.
:!: Do make a backup of your whole directory first! (andors-trail, together with the sub-directory "worldmap")


There are two new quests:
"Climbing up is forbidden"
After the thieves quests this is another great story from Ømicron, that blends in beautifully with the Blackwater Mountain area. Beware: Beginning with medium difficulty level, the second half is really hard. You should have developed your hero well before daring deep into the depths of the Elm mine...
Start at the foot of the mountains south east of Prim. (The path will be blocked if your hero is considered too weak for the quest)
"You're the postman"
This low level quest begins with Gorwath near your home. It was originally created by Lille1_opendev2015 more than 6 years ago. Almost forgotten, but fortunately Lord Ilham reminded us.


And there are also important engine changes:
Google has changed the requirements for storage access, so we had to change some basic things in Andor's Trail, otherwise it could not be published on Google Play any more.

- The update imports any existing savegames and copies them to an app specific area. (This might take a while - be patient!)
- Manual backups to PC are more difficult now. You won't get access to the saved games easily from a PC like before. But some file explorers like Total Commander should be able to do so.


Lastly, the actual translations.
    91% Deutsch (old 81%)
    90% Русский язык (old 93%)
    90% Español (old 77%)
    90% Italiano (old 93%)
    90% 日本人 (old 93%)
    90% Polski (old 80%)
    89% Português Brasil (old 93%)
    86% Française (old 93%)
    83% Português (old 90%)
    62% čeština (old 36%)
    41% 中文 (old 32%)
    39% Türkçe (old <30%)
    32% Magyar (old 35%)
Turkish translations had increased to over 30%, so I added it to the language selection. Special thanks to the Turkish translators!
(Because of the new content we have no complete translations at the moment of course ...)



Now here is the link to the productive version: static/AndorsTrail_v0.7.14.apk
And again:
:!: It is a good idea to BACKUP your saves + maps before doing anything else!

Thanks for your support and your patience.
We hope that you have as much fun playing it as we had on creation :)
